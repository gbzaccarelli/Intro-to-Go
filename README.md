# Intro to Go Workshop
## Getting Started
Go, or Golang, is a programming language inventeed by Google developers in 2007, and released in 2012, making it one of the more modern languages commonly used. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, and excellent support for concurrency, and is great to learn regardless of current programming knowlege.
If you are completely new to Go, we reccomend first completing [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/).

In this workshop, we'll test your understanding of the basics of Go, from its basic syntax to more complex data groups.

## Sections
- [BasicMath](basicMath/main.go) - Show you understand Go functions with some basic computation.
- [PrintInts](printInts/main.go) - Simply print out a list of numbers, with a small catch.
- [Slices](slices/main.go)    - Create slices of an array following different situations
- [Student](student/main.go)   - Use pointers to finish creating the Student class.
